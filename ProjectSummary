Project 1:
Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. 
Built general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.
  - Implemented Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, uniform-cost graph search algorithm, A* graph search

Project 2:
Designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. 
Implemented both minimax and expectimax search

Project 3: 
Implement value iteration and Q-learning. 
Tested agents first on Gridworld, then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman
Approximate Q-learning agent should win almost every time, even with only 50 training games!
